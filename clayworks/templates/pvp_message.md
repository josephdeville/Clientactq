# PVP Message Template

## Permissionless Value Proposition (PVP) Message Structure

### The Framework: Data Hook-Value-Action

**Test:** "Would they literally pay for this insight?"

---

## Template Structure

### Subject Line
```
[Specific finding about THEIR business, 3-5 words]
```

Examples:
- `Your ${company_name} tech infrastructure gaps`
- `${company_name} vs. ${competitor_count} competitors`
- `${compliance_framework} gaps at ${company_name}`

---

### Paragraph 1: DATA HOOK
**Purpose:** Lead with specific, quantified finding about their situation.

**Format:**
```
Analysis of [their public data source] shows [quantified finding]—
[specific examples: "including X, Y, and Z" or "specifically in areas A and B"].
```

**Example:**
```
Analysis of your public tech stack shows 3 potential security gaps—
including legacy auth methods on your customer portal, missing MFA on
your admin systems, and outdated SSL certificates on 2 subdomains.
```

---

### Paragraph 2: DIRECT VALUE
**Purpose:** Explain why this matters NOW and what peer companies did.

**Format:**
```
With [external deadline/pressure/requirement], [consequence of inaction
or opportunity cost]. [Peer companies] who [addressed this proactively]
[achieved specific, quantified outcome] by [specific approach].
```

**Example:**
```
With SOC 2 audits now requiring evidence of continuous security monitoring,
these gaps could delay your next certification. SaaS companies who addressed
infrastructure gaps proactively reduced their audit remediation time by 60%
and avoided the scramble that typically costs $50-100K in rushed fixes.
```

---

### Paragraph 3: VALUE EXTENSION
**Purpose:** Offer more related value (NOT a meeting).

**Format:**
```
Want the [complete/detailed/full] [analysis type] for your [specific scope]?
```

**Example:**
```
Want the complete security assessment for your public-facing infrastructure?
```
