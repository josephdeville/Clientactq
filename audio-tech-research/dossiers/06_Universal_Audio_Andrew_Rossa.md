### Email Templates

#### Template 1: Product Launch Attribution

**Subject**: Apollo E Series + X Gen 2 launch attribution question

Andrew,

Congrats on the Apollo E Series launch—moving into live sound/Dante is a smart expansion.

Quick question: With E Series, X Gen 2, Volt 876, and continuous UAD plugin launches, how does your team currently attribute pipeline back to specific product launches?

Most product marketing leaders at your launch velocity (5+ products in 18 months) struggle with:
→ Campaign-level ROI visibility across multiple simultaneous launches
→ Product-specific pipeline attribution when prospects engage with multiple products
→ Cross-sell tracking between hardware (Apollo) and software (UAD plugins)

We've helped product marketing teams at [similar company] automate launch attribution using Clay + HubSpot to:
- Track product-specific engagement and pipeline contribution
- Attribute revenue to launch campaigns vs. always-on demand gen
- Identify cross-sell patterns between product lines

Worth a 15-minute conversation to show you what automated launch attribution looks like?

[Your Name]

#### Template 2: Premium Positioning + Competitive Intelligence

**Subject**: Competitive intelligence for premium audio positioning

Andrew,

Universal Audio's premium positioning ($2K-$10K interfaces) in a market with $200 competitors is impressive—defending that premium requires constant competitive vigilance.

How does your PMM team currently track:
→ Win/loss reasons in competitive deals (UA vs. RME vs. Focusrite)?
→ Price objection patterns and sensitivity by customer segment?
→ Competitive messaging trends from lower-cost competitors?

We've built competitive intelligence systems for premium B2B brands using Clay + HubSpot to:
- Automate win/loss data collection and analysis
- Track competitor product launches and messaging changes
- Surface price sensitivity patterns by segment

Worth a brief call to show you automated competitive intelligence?

Best,
[Your Name]

#### Template 3: Market Expansion Attribution (Studio → Live Sound)

**Subject**: Attribution for your live sound market expansion

Andrew,

Saw Universal Audio at InfoComm 2025 with the Apollo E Series—smart move expanding from studio into live sound/Dante networking.

Question: As you expand into live sound, how are you segmenting attribution between:
→ Studio market (core business, established GTM)
→ Live sound market (new personas, different sales cycles)

Most PMM teams expanding into new markets struggle with:
- Segmenting pipeline by market to measure new market traction
- Optimizing GTM spend when ROI differs dramatically by segment
- Understanding persona differences between studio engineers vs. live sound professionals

We've helped companies like [similar] build market-segmented attribution using Clay + HubSpot during market expansion.
